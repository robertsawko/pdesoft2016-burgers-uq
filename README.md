# Uncertaintly quantification on Burgers equation in OpenFOAM

The repository contains a OpenFOAM source code and configuration files for
uncertainty quantification studies with [Burgers'
equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgers'_equation).


## Implementation notes

The formulation for intrusive UQ for viscous Burgers' in `gPCBurgersFoam` was
based on [1] section 6.5, page 76.
